# Usage
Make sure you have node installed. To check, run:
`node -v `

Once node is installed, run the `index.js` file using:
`node index.js`

## **WARNING**
`index-old.js` is deprecated and will likely not work. Make sure to run `index.js` instead. `index-old.js` is only there if we screw up the new one.
